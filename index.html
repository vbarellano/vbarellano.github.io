            <h2>Favorite CMSC Subject and Reason</h2>
            <p>My favorite CMSC course is CMSC 22, which is all about Object-Oriented Programming. 
                The subject allowed me to import my creative side. 
                Moreover, I enjoyed designing our very own game.

            <h2>Favorite GE Course and Reason</h2>
            <p>My favorite GE Course is PS 21, which is all about the status of the Philippines during the Marcos years.
                This subject allowed us to gain knowledge which is highly important in having critical analysis about the dictatorship's years.
                Furthermore, the knowledge obtained is highly significant in preventing the repetition of our history.

            <h2>Favorite Programming Language and Reason</h2>
            <p>As of the moment, my favorite programming language is Java. The discussion attached with it allowed me to understand the blueprint of software design.
                Moreover, the simplicity of the syntax of this high-level, class-based, object-oriented language is favorable to me.
