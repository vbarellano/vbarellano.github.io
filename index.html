                <!--Nickname-->
                Hello! I am <span id="fullName_p">Von Michael B. Arellano</span>. However, everyone calls me <span id="Nickname">Von</span>.

                <!--Favorite CMSC Course-->
                I like <span id="Fave_CMSC_Subject">CMSC 22</span> among all the other Computer Science courses. This course is all about Object-Oriented Programming. 
                I like this subject because it allowed me to import my creative side. Moreover, I enjoyed designing our very own game.
                <br><br>
                <!--Favorite GE Course-->
                In terms of General Education Courses, <span id="Fave_GE_Course">PS 21</span> is my favorite among them. This subject is all about the status of the 
                Philippines during the Marcos years. This subject allowed us to gain knowledge which is highly important in having critical analysis about the dictatorship's 
                years. Furthermore, the knowledge obtained is highly significant in preventing the repetition of our history.
                <br><br>
                <!--Favorite Programming Language-->
                As of the moment, my favorite programming language is <span id="Fave_PL">Java</span> for the reason that it allowed me to understand the blueprint of software design.
                Moreover, the simplicity of the syntax of this high-level, class-based, object-oriented language is favorable to me. 
                <br><br>
                <!--Favorite Food-->
                Among the various foods in my list, <span id="Fave_Food">Bicol Express</span> is one of my favorite.
