        <!--Nickname-->
        <p>Hello! I am Von Michael. However, everyone calls me <span id="Nickname">Von</span>.</p>

        <!--Favorite CMSC Course-->
        <p>My favorite Computer Science course is <span id="Fave_CMSC_Subject">CMSC 22</span>, which is all about Object-Oriented Programming. 
            The subject allowed me to import my creative side. Moreover, I enjoyed designing our very own game.

        <!--Favorite GE Course-->
        <p>My favorite General Education Course is <span id="Fave_GE_Course">PS 21</span>, which is all about the status of the Philippines during the Marcos years.
            This subject allowed us to gain knowledge which is highly important in having critical analysis about the dictatorship's years.
            Furthermore, the knowledge obtained is highly significant in preventing the repetition of our history.
        </p>
        
        <!--Favorite Programming Language-->
        <p>As of the moment, my favorite programming language is <span id="Fave_PL">Java</span>. The discussion attached with it allowed me to understand the blueprint of software design.
                Moreover, the simplicity of the syntax of this high-level, class-based, object-oriented language is favorable to me.
