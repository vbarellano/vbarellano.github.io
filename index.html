        <p>Hi! You can call me <div name="Nickname">Von</div></p>

        <p>My favorite CMSC course is <div name="Favorite CMSC Subject">CMSC 22</div>, which is all about Object-Oriented Programming. 
            The subject allowed me to import my creative side. Moreover, I enjoyed designing our very own game.

        <p>My favorite GE Course is <div name="Favorite GE Course">PS 21</div>, which is all about the status of the Philippines during the Marcos years.
            This subject allowed us to gain knowledge which is highly important in having critical analysis about the dictatorship's years.
            Furthermore, the knowledge obtained is highly significant in preventing the repetition of our history.
        </p>
        
        <p>As of the moment, my favorite programming language is <div name="Favorite PL">Java</div>. The discussion attached with it allowed me to understand the blueprint of software design.
                Moreover, the simplicity of the syntax of this high-level, class-based, object-oriented language is favorable to me.
